Sends post and page interactions to a designated bot user webhook.

== Description ==
If you're looking to have your discord channel updated with the latest going on with your WordPress blog, look no further. With this plugin, all post & page activity on your site will post an update to a channel/webhook of your choice!

This plugin is **open source** and [can be found here](https://github.com/ReviveToday/Messenger-for-Discord).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where do I find webooks? =
**You must be admin of the channel/server to see webhooks.** Pop into **server settings**, click on **Integrations**, and click on **Webhooks**. From here you can either create a new bot user, or give it the webhook URL of an existing one.

This is also accessible by right-clicking a desired channel, and clicking **Edit channel**.

It's recommended to setup a mod/admin-only visible channel and grab the webhook for that to test the functionality out without notifying your Discord server users.
